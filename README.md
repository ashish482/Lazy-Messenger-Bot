# Lazy-Messenger-Bot
An automation messenger bot that helps control  youtube just by texting bot integrated with  FACEBOOK MESSENGER using  key terms like play <song-name>, seek-to <time-in-seconds>, pause, resume, mute, unmute and many more.
And also getting news updates  from TIMES OF INDIA  just by texting the bot key terms like show headlines, <topic> updates.
For automation we are using SELENIUM - A  PYTHON API to access all functionalities of the system WebDriver in an intuitive way.
          For news functionality we are using  beautiful soup library to scrap TOI news headlines Data. To automate the above tasks we are using selenium chrome drivers to interact our system with the fb messenger by parsing each command to make two way communication.
